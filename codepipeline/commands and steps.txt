✅ AWS CodePipeline + CodeDeploy – Interview Questions & Answers (Based on Your Lab)
🔹 Fundamentals
Q1. What is AWS CodePipeline?

A fully managed CI/CD orchestration service that automates code release workflows across AWS services.

Q2. Why did you introduce CodePipeline when CodeDeploy already existed?

CodeDeploy handles deployment, but CodePipeline automates the entire release flow, removing manual CLI/console triggers.

Q3. What problem does CodePipeline solve in this lab?

It enables automatic deployments whenever application code changes in the source bucket.

🔹 High-Level Architecture (VERY IMPORTANT)
Q4. Explain the architecture of this lab.

CodePipeline monitors an S3 bucket, detects changes, and triggers CodeDeploy, which deploys the application to EC2 instances across multiple AZs.

Q5. What are the stages used in this pipeline?

Source: Amazon S3

Deploy: AWS CodeDeploy
(Build and Test stages were skipped)

Q6. Why is S3 used as the source stage?

Because the application artifacts are pre-built ZIP files, not source code requiring compilation.

🔹 Source Stage (S3)
Q7. Why must S3 versioning be enabled for CodePipeline?

CodePipeline tracks object versions to detect changes and trigger deployments.

Q8. How does CodePipeline detect a change in S3?

Using Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) on object upload.

Q9. What triggers the pipeline in this lab?

Uploading or overwriting HeartBeat-App.zip in the S3 source bucket.

Q10. Is polling used here?

No. The pipeline uses event-based triggers, not polling.

🔹 IAM & Security
Q11. Why does CodePipeline need a service role?

To interact with S3, CodeDeploy, CloudWatch, and other AWS services securely.

Q12. What role was used in this lab?

AWSCodePipelineServiceRole-<region>-HeartBeatPipeline

Q13. Principle followed by the service role?

Least privilege — permissions limited to required services only.

🔹 Build & Test Stages (Tricky Interview Area)
Q14. Why was the build stage skipped?

The application was already compiled and packaged as a ZIP.

Q15. When would you need a build stage?

When source code needs compilation, testing, or artifact creation (using CodeBuild).

Q16. Can you add build/test stages later?

Yes, pipelines are fully extensible.

🔹 Deploy Stage (CodeDeploy)
Q17. Why was CodeDeploy used as the deploy provider?

Because it supports Windows services, lifecycle hooks, and EC2 fleet deployments.

Q18. What deployment type was used?

In-place deployment on existing EC2 instances.

Q19. How does CodePipeline know where to deploy?

It references the CodeDeploy application and deployment group.

Q20. How were target instances selected?

Using EC2 tags (Name = HeartBeat-Instance).

🔹 Automation & Flow Control
Q21. What happens after uploading a new ZIP to S3?

Event triggers pipeline

Source stage succeeds

Deploy stage calls CodeDeploy

CodeDeploy runs appspec hooks

Q22. Is any manual action required after pipeline creation?

No. Deployments are fully automatic.

Q23. How can you manually force a deployment?

Using Release change in the CodePipeline console.

🔹 Monitoring & Observability
Q24. How do you monitor pipeline execution?

Through the CodePipeline console, stage-by-stage status.

Q25. How do you monitor deployment-level details?

Using CodeDeploy → Deployments.

Q26. What happens if deployment fails?

Pipeline shows failed state, and rollback can occur if configured.

🔹 Verification & Validation
Q27. How did you verify deployment success?

Checked Windows service status

Checked application logs

Q28. Why use Systems Manager Session Manager?

Secure, agent-based access without SSH/RDP or public IPs.

Q29. What confirmed the updated deployment worked?

Log message:

Heartbeat Service - Updated!!!

🔹 Updating Code (VERY COMMON)
Q30. How did you simulate a new release?

Uploaded an updated ZIP file with the same object key.

Q31. Why keep the same S3 object key?

So the pipeline consistently tracks one source artifact.

Q32. Can CodePipeline handle multiple environments?

Yes, using multiple pipelines or stages (dev, test, prod).

🔹 Scaling & Production Readiness
Q33. Will this pipeline scale to 100+ instances?

Yes. CodeDeploy and CodePipeline scale automatically.

Q34. Can this pipeline deploy to Auto Scaling Groups?

Yes, CodeDeploy natively supports ASGs.

Q35. How would you add approval before production?

Add a Manual approval stage in CodePipeline.

🔹 Comparison Questions (Interview Gold)
Q36. CodePipeline vs Jenkins?

CodePipeline is AWS-native and managed; Jenkins is self-managed and flexible.

Q37. CodePipeline vs GitHub Actions?

CodePipeline integrates deeply with AWS IAM and services.

Q38. CodePipeline vs CodeDeploy?

CodePipeline orchestrates; CodeDeploy executes deployments.

🔹 Failure & Recovery
Q39. What happens if the deploy stage fails?

Pipeline stops, marks execution as failed, and alerts can be sent.

Q40. Can pipelines be rolled back?

Pipeline doesn’t rollback itself; CodeDeploy handles rollback.

🔹 Final Interview Closers (MEMORIZE)
Q41. Explain this lab in 30 seconds

“I built a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline that automatically deploys a Windows service from an S3 source to an EC2 fleet using CodeDeploy, removing manual deployment steps and enabling event-driven releases.”

Q42. Why is this important for DevOps roles?

It demonstrates automation, CI/CD design, IAM, observability, and deployment reliability.
